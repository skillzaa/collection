# What is Collection Object
>> This is a **wrapper class** to wrap an **array of Objects** and provide useful methods to help managa that array of object.
------
>> It takes an array of objects and provide an interface using which we can easily manage that array.

## Why we need an Object for Array of Objects:
When ever we have an array of objects we have items organized in an indexed array ut what we want is to refer to the items using their ids 
(just like in a database). This object solves this issue bu provinding an interface using which conversion from id to Index or from Index to id is not an issue.
In addition to that there are many methods using which we can add , delete , sort and search this array.

##How it Works
>>When we create a collection object its creates an empty array and we are provided a number of methods to use.
>>The array of Objects is accessable throught **collection.data**.
